Hello! I am currently a graduate student in climate science at Universit√§t Hamburg. My academic interests include understanding drivers of climate extremes and modelling their impacts on natural and societal systems. I am also interested in data visualization, science communication, and supporting collaborative and open science communities such as [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io).
