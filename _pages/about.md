Hello! I am a currently graduate student in climate science at Universit√§t Hamburg. My academic interests include understanding drivers of climate extremes and modelling their cascading impacts on natural and societal systems. I am also interested in data visualization, science communication, and developing and promoting collaborative and open science in the geosciences via tools such as [pangeo](https://pangeo.io).
