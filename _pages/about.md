Hello! I am a graduate student in climate sciences at the [School of Integrated Climate System Science](https://sicss.de) at the University of Hamburg, and a research assistant in the [Climate Extremes research group](https://www.fnk.uni-hamburg.de/2-research/research-group-climate-extremes.html) at the University of Hamburg. I am interested climate extremes, particularly how they will evolve in a changing climate and how they create complex and interconnected risks for nature and society. Besides this, I am also passionate about data visualization, science communication, and collaborative open science communities such as [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io).
