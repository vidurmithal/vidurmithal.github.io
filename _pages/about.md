Hello! I am a graduate student in climate sciences at the [School of Integrated Climate System Science](https://sicss.de) at Universit√§t Hamburg, and a research assistant at the [Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research](https://www.ufz.de/). I am interested climate extremes, particularly how they will evolve in a changing climate and how they create complex and interconnected risks for nature and society. Besides this, I am also passionate about data visualization, science communication, and collaborative open science communities such as [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io).
